# Setup

## Installation

Install the library with Composer:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "myclabs/acl": "*"
    }
}
```

## Configuration

You first need to register the annotation mapping to your Doctrine metadata driver.
Here is for example how you would do it with the most basic Doctrine configuration:

```php
$paths = [
    // Your model classes
    __DIR__ . '/../src/My/Model',

    // MyCLabs ACL model classes (adjust the directory)
    __DIR__ . '/../vendor/myclabs/acl/src/Model',
];

// Doctrine configuration
$config = Setup::createConfiguration($isDevMode);
// Myclabs/ACL uses namespaces annotations
$config->setMetadataDriverImpl($config->newDefaultAnnotationDriver($paths, false));
$em = EntityManager::create($dbParams, $config);
```

Creating the ACL object is simple:

```php
$acl = new ACL($entityManager);
```

Note that you'll need to define a SecurityIdentity class, usually a user class
(you can see an example in the [Usage section](usage.md)).

Then, you must separately register some listeners on the entity manager and your roles.
The `ACLSetup` class is here to help you:

```php
$aclSetup = new \MyCLabs\ACL\Doctrine\ACLSetup();
// Set which class implements the SecurityIdentityInterface (must be called once)
$aclSetup->setSecurityIdentityClass('My\Model\User');
// Register roles
$aclSetup->registerRoles([ 'ArticleEditorRole' => [
                                'resource' => 'My\Model\Article',
                                'actions' => new Actions([ Actions::Edit ]) ]
                         ]);

// Apply the configuration to the entity manager
$aclSetup->setUpEntityManager($entityManager, function () use ($acl) { return $acl; });
```

These listeners handle different things, like registering your role and user classes, and registering
a listener that will act when new resources/entities are created (to cascade authorizations).

## Using a container

You can also use a container to avoid instantiating the ACL uselessly (and avoid a circular dependency):

```php
$aclLocator = function () {
    return $container->get('MyCLabs\ACL\ACL');
};

$aclSetup->setUpEntityManager($entityManager, $aclLocator);
```

## Cascade delete

To be as efficient as possible, MyCLabs\ACL uses `ON DELETE CASCADE` at database level.

For example, when a role is removed, all of its authorizations will be deleted in cascade by MySQL/SQLite/â€¦
That allows to bypass using Doctrine's "cascade remove" which loads all the entities in memory (there could
be thousands of authorizations).

However this means **your database must support CASCADE operations**. MySQL and PostgreSQL support it,
but SQLite usually [needs a configuration step](http://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable):

```php
$entityManager->getConnection()->executeQuery('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');
```
